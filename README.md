![Vol13No2-3_Ear_San_fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67580321/171864905-2d47f7ee-3928-4e75-a81a-9c76fd456ad9.jpg)

## Problem Statement 
Farmers who grow potatoes are often plagued by serious financial losses each year, which lead to several diseases that affect potato plants. The diseases Early Blight and Late Blight are the most common diseases. Early blight is caused by fungus, and late blight is caused by specific micro-organisms. If farmers detect this disease early and apply appropriate treatment, it can save a lot of crop production and prevent economic loss. There are different treatments for early blight and late blight, so it's important to be accurate in identifying the type of disease present in your potato plant. Behind the scenes, we will use Convolutional Neural Network - Deep Learning to diagnose plant diseases.

## Project Description
Development of a deep learning project in the field of agriculture We will create a simple image classification model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple convolutional neural network architecture. We'll start by collecting the data, and then we'll build models to explain it.

## Data Collection
Using data that I got from Kaggle.
